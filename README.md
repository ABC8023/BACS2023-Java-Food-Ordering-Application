The BaoBaoPizza Ordering System is designed to streamline the ordering process for customers of BaoBaoPizza, a renowned pizza place known for its delicious and diverse pizza offerings. The program allows customers to place orders for their favourite pizzas. The system includes features such as processing payments and point reward system to earn points and more. Let's talk about the point reward system. As users use our program to purchase our products, they will earn 1 point per RM10 spent. As an example, when a customer spends RM20, 2 points will be stored into his/her account. Customers will get a x1.5 bonus after 1000 points collected; x1.8 bonus after 2000 points collected and x2 bonus after 3000 points collected. After purchasing RM200 worth of products in a single purchase, the user is eligible to participate in the lucky draw activity where they can win prizes like bonus points or exclusive products. Staff can use their staff accounts to search and check the purchase history of customers, which includes the transaction date, amount, points earned and purchased content. We use 2 text files to store different informationï¼Œ one of the text files includes customer details (register details, number of points and voucher), and the other includes customer order. With its intuitive interface and efficient functionality, the BaoBaoPizza Ordering System ensures a seamless and enjoyable ordering experience for customers while enhancing operational efficiency for the pizza place.
